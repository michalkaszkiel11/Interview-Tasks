Task:

Develop a web app using JS that sends HTTP requests to the Unsplash.com API (Unsplash Image
API) and retrieves the data with one or more of the following parameter(s), e.g.:
- Most viewed photos
- oldest photos
- popular photos

1. The web app should have a design concept. It does not have to be complex; a clear design
idea and its structure are going to be enough.
2. You are not allowed to use frameworks, i.e. it must be written in Vanilla JS.
3. The app structure/functionality/parameters etc. are up to you!
Note:
Please note, the Unsplash.com API limits the number of requests (Unsplash Rate Limiting).
